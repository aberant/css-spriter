 \(°_°)/ -> SPRITES!!!


It takes your PNG's, chews them up and spits out sprites!

point bin/spittle at a directory, and watch it sprite away!

INSTALLATION

We're hosted at gemcutter.  I believe 'sudo gem install gemcutter' then 'gem tumble'.
Then you can run: 

> sudo gem install spittle

USAGE

> spittle <directory>

For a full list of options:

> spittle -h

LIMITATIONS

- only supports images of the same height and color type.
- only supports RGB and RGBA color types
- does not support color profiles (can cause a slight change in color from the source image)

FEATURES

- automatically generates PNG sprites from a set of PNG images
- automatically generates css classes to access images within the sprite
- customize the css template for each sprite 

ROADMAP - by priority

- Rails plugin & rake tasks
- Support varying height in source images
- Use mtime tracking to prevent regeneration of sprites that have not changed
- Support color profiles
- Support global css template override
