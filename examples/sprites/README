The sprites here are pre generated.  If you want to see it work yourself delete the the two sprite.png files and all the *.css.  Then simply run '../bin/spittle' and it should regenreate the sprites. 

The server script will start a WEBrick server on port 3000 and serve from this directory.  If everything worked out you should see the two sprite samples displayed in index.html.
